This is a personal/portfolio site for Robert Henderson, senior frontend software engineer. Feel free to use any of the code for your own project, or submit a pull request if you want :).

This is a NextJS project using React and Typescript with TailwindCSS as the styling framework. All components are custom built, with only a few using HeadlessUI as a base. I am deploying the site using Vercel.

Please use the [contact form](https://roberthenderson.me/contact) on the site to send me a message if you have any questions.

### Some cool features I'm proud of:
- Dark mode/Light mode
- Reusable section components
- Auto scroll route updates (for link sharing)
- Generated OG image for link sharing
- Pixel perfect responsive web design
- Designed the whole site myself with code
